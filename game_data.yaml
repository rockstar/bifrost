intro:
    You wake up in a pool of your own blood. The lights are flickering, and there's
    and alarm sounding somewhere else in the ship. Your room is a mess, as if someone
    was looking for something, and they didn't find what they were looking for.
help:
    There is no help. You're on your own. Good luck.

    To leave, type 'END'
